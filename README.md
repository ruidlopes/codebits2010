## Human-powered Javascript Compression for Fun and Gummy Bears

Accompanying code for [my talk](http://codebits.eu/intra/s/proposal/52) at [Codebits 2010](http://codebits.eu/).


## Synopsis

Javascript is teh sh*t.

Apart from performance reasons, compressing Javascript is a hot topic, e.g., due to contests like [10K Apart](http://10k.aneventapart.com/) or [js1k](http://js1k.com/). Current software-based Javascript compression techniques aren't as good as humans.

The goal of this hands-on talk is to mind bend your knowledge on Javascript. I promise to commit *as many* sacrileges and profanities to the Javascript language as humanely possible.

We'll start with a nice script - feel free to suggest some in the comments - establish a goal in terms of *bytes*, and keep compressing until the goal has been reached or Entropy limits arise.

At the end, you're either slap me or kiss me. Either way, I hope you'll enjoy it (the talk, not the kiss).
